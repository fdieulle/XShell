## XShell 
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/fdieulle/XShell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fdieulle/XShell)

Shell for any client application framework based on Ioc
This framework allows you to build client applications easly by providing many services to manage your screens, menus, background tasks and more. It supports the 3 main design patterns used in client application: Mvc, Mvp and Mvvm.

I provide 2 demos one in Winform and the other in Wpf which show you how to use this framework and adapt it on any client application framework.
